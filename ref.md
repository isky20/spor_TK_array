* **Busby et al., Nature Communications (2023)** — builds and validates **ancestry-specific PRSs**, and reports effects **per SD** and **percentile-based thresholds** ( score within the intended ancestry group and interpret by distribution). ([Nature][2])
* **Privé et al., American Journal of Human Genetics (2022)** — derives PGS in one ancestry and applies across multiple ancestry groups **within the same cohort**, showing strong portability decay; also uses **two predictive methods** ( idea  “same trait, different models”). ([PubMed][3])
